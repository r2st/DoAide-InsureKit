  {
    q: "How long does LIC take to settle a maturity claim?",
    a: "30 days from the maturity date for registered policies. If your NEFT details and PAN are updated in LIC records, the maturity amount is auto-credited to your bank account without any claim forms. For unregistered policies, the process may take 45-60 days after you submit all required documents at your servicing branch.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents are needed for a death claim?",
    a: "Original policy bond (or indemnity bond if lost), death certificate issued by municipal authority, claimant's identity proof (Aadhaar/PAN), claimant's bank account details, NEFT mandate form, and the claim form (Form 3783/3816). For accidental death claims, you also need the FIR copy, post-mortem report, police inquest report, and treating hospital records if applicable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a nominee file a claim without the original policy bond?",
    a: "Yes. The nominee must submit an indemnity bond (on stamp paper) and a notarized affidavit declaring that the original policy bond is lost or destroyed. LIC may also ask for a newspaper advertisement about the lost bond for policies with higher sum assured. The claim process continues normally after these additional documents are accepted.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the policyholder dies within 3 years?",
    a: "This is classified as an 'early claim' and LIC investigates more thoroughly. The claim undergoes detailed scrutiny including medical history verification, cause of death investigation, and agent report. The outcome can be: full claim settlement if everything is in order, repudiation (rejection) if material non-disclosure is found, or ex-gratia settlement at a reduced amount as a goodwill gesture when there is partial non-disclosure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is TDS deducted on LIC claim amount?",
    a: "It depends on the claim type. Death claim proceeds are fully exempt from income tax under Section 10(10D) - no TDS is deducted. For maturity claims, if the annual premium exceeds 10% of the sum assured (5% for policies issued after 1 April 2012 with SA above Rs 10 lakh), TDS at 5% is deducted on amounts exceeding Rs 1 lakh. Submit Form 15G/15H to avoid TDS if your total income is below the taxable limit.",
  },
  {
    q: "How to check LIC claim status online?",
    a: "Visit licindia.in and go to Online Services > Claim Status. Enter your policy number and date of birth. The portal shows the current status of your claim - whether it is registered, under process, approved, or settled. You can also call LIC customer care at 022-68276827 or visit your servicing branch for a status update.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a legal heir file a claim if there is no nominee?",
    a: "Yes, but the process is longer. The legal heir must obtain a succession certificate or legal heir certificate from a civil court. Along with this, they need to submit all regular claim documents plus an indemnity bond and affidavit. For smaller claim amounts (typically below Rs 1 lakh), LIC may accept a legal heir certificate from the tehsildar or revenue authority instead of a court order.",

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          LIC policyholders or their nominees can file different types of claims depending on
          the policy event. Understanding which claim type applies to your situation is the first
          step in the process. Each claim type has its own set of documents, procedures, and
          settlement timelines.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Below are the four main types of claims you can file with LIC. The process and
          documentation requirements differ for each, so make sure you identify the correct
          claim type before proceeding.

              Filed when the policy completes its full term and the sum assured plus accumulated
              bonuses become payable. This is the most straightforward claim type. If your NEFT
              details are registered, LIC auto-credits the amount on the maturity date.

              Filed by the nominee or legal heir when the policyholder passes away during the
              policy term. The sum assured plus vested bonuses are paid to the claimant. Death

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          The maturity claim is the simplest of all LIC claims. When your policy completes its
          full term, the maturity amount (sum assured + vested bonuses + final additional bonus)
          becomes payable. LIC typically sends a maturity intimation letter or SMS about 2-3
          months before the maturity date, reminding you to update your bank details.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If you are a registered user on the LIC portal and your NEFT/bank details and PAN are

          A death claim is filed by the nominee (or legal heir if no nominee is registered)

          the sum assured, all vested bonuses, and the final additional bonus declared by LIC.

        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          LIC categorizes death claims into two types based on when the death occurs relative

            If the policyholder dies within 3 years of policy issuance or revival, it is classified

            proposal form details, medical history, cause of death, and agent's report. This process
            can take 90-180 days. The claim may be settled in full, repudiated if fraud or
            non-disclosure is found, or settled at a reduced ex-gratia amount.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          If no nominee is registered on the policy, the legal heir must first establish their
          right to receive the claim amount. This requires a succession certificate from a civil
          court or a legal heir certificate from the tehsildar (for smaller amounts). The legal
          heir then follows the same process as a nominee, with the additional court documents.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          For claim amounts below Rs 1 lakh, LIC may accept a legal heir certificate from the
          revenue authority (tehsildar) along with an indemnity bond. For larger amounts, a
          court-issued succession certificate is mandatory. The legal heir process typically takes
          3-6 months longer than a nominee claim due to the court proceedings.

      <section id="survival-benefit" className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Survival Benefit Claim</h2>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Survival benefit is a feature of money-back policies (like Jeevan Tarun, Jeevan Shiromani,
          Bima Bachat, etc.) where a fixed percentage of the sum assured is paid out at regular
          intervals during the policy term. For example, in a 20-year money-back plan, you might
          receive 20% of the sum assured at the end of 5th, 10th, and 15th year, with the remaining
          40% plus bonuses paid at maturity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          If your bank details (NEFT) are registered with LIC, survival benefit payouts are
          auto-credited to your bank account on the due date. No forms or branch visits are
          required. LIC sends an SMS notification when the amount is credited.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If the payout is not auto-credited, you need to submit a Discharge Voucher at your
          servicing branch along with the policy bond for endorsement. LIC will process the
          survival benefit and credit it within 7-15 working days. Keep in mind that all premiums
          must be paid up to the survival benefit due date for the payout to be processed.

            <span className="text-signal font-semibold">Important:</span> Survival benefit is
            only paid if all premiums due up to that date have been paid. If your policy is lapsed
            or has unpaid premiums, the survival benefit will be withheld until the policy is
            revived. Register your NEFT details on the LIC portal to ensure automatic payouts.

          LIC is mandated by IRDAI regulations to settle claims within a stipulated time frame.
          Delays beyond the prescribed period entitle the claimant to penal interest from LIC.
          However, actual settlement timelines depend on the claim type, completeness of

            to 6-12 months. During investigation, LIC may request additional documents, conduct
            field visits, or seek medical opinions. If you believe LIC is causing unnecessary

          LIC rejects (repudiates) a small percentage of claims each year. Understanding the
          common reasons for rejection can help you avoid these pitfalls and ensure your family
          receives the claim amount without issues. Most rejections happen in death claims,
          particularly early death claims.

          Below are the most common reasons LIC rejects claims. Being aware of these can help

              The most common reason for rejection. If the policyholder did not disclose a
              pre-existing medical condition (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) at the
              time of purchasing the policy, and death occurs due to or related to that condition,
              LIC can repudiate the claim. Always declare your complete medical history truthfully
              in the proposal form.

              If premiums have not been paid and the policy has lapsed, no claim is payable.
              Even if the policyholder dies during the grace period (30 days for annual/half-yearly,
              15 days for monthly premiums), the claim may be settled after deducting the due
              premium. A fully lapsed policy has no cover, and the claim will be outright rejected.{" "}

              address and mobile number so you receive all policy communications including
              maturity intimation and premium reminders.

            </div>
            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Your family should know about all your insurance policies - policy numbers, the
              servicing branch, nominee details, and where the policy bonds are stored. Many
              claims go unclaimed simply because the family is unaware of the policy's existence.
              Consider creating a simple document listing all your policies with key details and
              share it with your spouse or a trusted family member.

              This is the single most impactful step for hassle-free claims. With NEFT and PAN
              registered, maturity and survival benefit claims are auto-settled without any
              paperwork. Log in to licindia.in, go to e-Services, and complete the NEFT mandate
              registration. Verify that the bank account details shown are correct.

              Store the original policy bond, premium receipts, and any correspondence from LIC
              in a safe place. If the original bond is lost, report it to LIC immediately and
              obtain a duplicate. While claims can be processed without the original bond (using
              an indemnity bond), having the original significantly speeds up the settlement
              process.

              When buying a policy or reviving a lapsed one, declare your complete medical
              history truthfully. Non-disclosure of pre-existing conditions is the number one
              reason for death claim rejection. Even if it means paying a slightly higher premium,
              honest disclosure protects your family's claim in the future.
