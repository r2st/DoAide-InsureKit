          LIC policies offer tax benefits at three distinct stages of the policy lifecycle, making
          them one of the most popular tax-saving instruments in India. Understanding these benefits
          is essential to maximise your after-tax returns and avoid unexpected tax liabilities when
          your policy matures or if you decide to surrender it early.

          Tax saving remains one of the primary reasons millions of Indians invest in LIC endowment
          and money-back plans every year. However, the introduction of the new tax regime in 2020
          and subsequent amendments have changed the tax landscape significantly. Many policyholders
          are no longer sure whether their LIC premium qualifies for a deduction or whether their
          maturity proceeds will be taxable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          This guide covers every aspect of LIC taxation in detail, from premium deductions and
          maturity exemptions to surrender penalties and regime-specific rules. Whether you hold an
          endowment plan, a term policy, a ULIP, or an LIC pension plan, you will find the exact
          tax treatment that applies to your situation.

      <section id="section-80c" className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Section 80C Deduction on Premiums</h2>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, premiums paid towards a life insurance policy
          qualify for a deduction from your gross total income, up to a maximum of &#8377;1,50,000
          per financial year. This deduction is available only under the old tax regime. If you have
          opted for the new tax regime (default from AY 2024-25 onwards), you cannot claim this
          deduction.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          The &#8377;1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C is a combined limit shared with several other
          investments. Your EPF contribution, PPF deposits, ELSS mutual funds, NSC, tax-saving FDs,
          children's tuition fees, and home loan principal repayment all compete for the same
          &#8377;1.5 lakh space. If your EPF and PPF alone consume the entire limit, paying LIC
          premium adds no additional tax benefit under 80C.
        </p>
        <div className="panel p-4 border-l-4 border-l-signal mb-4">
          <p className="text-white/60 text-sm">
            <span className="text-signal font-semibold">10% Sum Assured Rule:</span> For policies
            issued on or after 1 April 2012, only the portion of premium that does not exceed 10% of
            the sum assured qualifies for 80C deduction. For policies issued before this date, the
            threshold is 20%. For example, if your sum assured is &#8377;5,00,000, the maximum
            qualifying premium is &#8377;50,000 per year for post-2012 policies.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          You can claim Section 80C deduction on premiums paid for policies covering yourself, your
          spouse, or your children (including adult children). Premiums paid for parents' or
          siblings' policies do not qualify. If you are part of a HUF (Hindu Undivided Family), the
          HUF can claim deductions on premiums paid for policies on any member of the HUF, but the
          same premium cannot be claimed by both the HUF and the individual.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          The deduction is available on a payment basis, meaning you claim it in the year you
          actually pay the premium, not the year it was due. If you pay two years' premiums in a
          single financial year, only one year's premium qualifies (the excess is not carried
          forward). Keep your premium paid receipt or the statement from the LIC portal as proof for
          your ITR filing.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act exempts the maturity proceeds of a life insurance
          policy from income tax, provided certain conditions are met. This applies to the sum
          assured, bonuses, and any additional amounts received on maturity. Unlike 80C, this
          exemption is available under both the old and new tax regimes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The exemption covers endowment plans, money-back plans, term plans (if they have a

              The annual premium must not exceed 10% of the sum assured for policies issued on or

              The policy must have been in force for at least 5 years (or 2 years for term insurance

              Section 112A (10% on gains exceeding &#8377;1.25 lakh). Below &#8377;2.5 lakh premium,
              normal 10(10D) exemption applies.

              For policies on the life of a person with disability (as defined under Section 80U) or
              suffering from specified diseases (Section 80DDB), the premium threshold is relaxed to

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Surrendering an LIC policy before its term ends can trigger two separate tax consequences.
          First, the surrender value itself may be taxable if the 10(10D) exemption conditions are
          not met. Second, if you claimed 80C deductions on premiums in earlier years and surrender
          the policy before completing 5 years, those deductions are reversed.

            <span className="text-bad font-semibold">80C Reversal (Section 80C(5)):</span> If you
            surrender a policy before completing 5 premium-paying years, the total 80C deductions
            claimed on that policy in previous years are added back to your taxable income in the
            year of surrender. For example, if you claimed &#8377;50,000 each year for 3 years and
            then surrendered, &#8377;1,50,000 gets added to your income in the surrender year.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          The taxability of the surrender value itself depends on whether 10(10D) conditions are
          met. If the policy was held for more than 5 years and the premium never exceeded 10% of
          sum assured, the surrender value is tax-free. Otherwise, the surrender value (minus total
          premiums paid) is taxable as "Income from Other Sources" at your slab rate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          LIC deducts TDS at 5% on the taxable surrender amount if it exceeds &#8377;1 lakh. You
          will receive a Form 16A from LIC showing the TDS deducted. Report the surrender proceeds
          in your ITR under "Income from Other Sources" and claim credit for the TDS deducted.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Death claims from LIC policies are fully exempt from income tax under Section 10(10D).
          This exemption applies unconditionally: there is no premium-to-sum-assured ratio check,
          no minimum holding period, and no distinction between old and new tax regimes. The entire
          death benefit, including the sum assured, accrued bonuses, and any additional rider
          benefits, is received completely tax-free by the nominee or legal heir.

            the premium was 5% or 50% of sum assured, the death claim is always fully tax-free.
            This is one of the strongest tax advantages of life insurance.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          However, the interest earned on the death claim amount after it is received by the
          nominee is taxable. If the nominee deposits the claim amount in a bank fixed deposit, the
          interest earned on that FD is taxable under "Income from Other Sources". Only the
          insurance payout itself is exempt, not the returns earned on it subsequently.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Different types of LIC plans receive different tax treatment. Here is a breakdown for
          the most common plan categories.

            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Premiums qualify for 80C deduction (old regime). Maturity and survival benefits are
              exempt under 10(10D) if premium does not exceed 10% of sum assured. These are the
              most common LIC plans and the standard tax rules apply. Examples: Jeevan Anand, Jeevan
              Lakshya, New Endowment Plan.

            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Premiums qualify for 80C deduction (old regime). Since term plans are pure protection
              with no maturity benefit, the 10(10D) question arises only on death claims, which are
              always fully exempt. Term premiums are usually well within the 10% SA threshold, so
              the full premium qualifies for 80C. Examples: LIC Tech Term, Jeevan Amar.

            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Premiums qualify for 80C deduction (old regime). For policies issued after 1 Feb 2021
              with annual premium above &#8377;2.5 lakh, maturity proceeds are treated as capital
              gains and taxed at 10% on gains above &#8377;1.25 lakh. Below &#8377;2.5 lakh
              premium, standard 10(10D) exemption applies. Multiple ULIPs are aggregated for the
              &#8377;2.5 lakh threshold. Examples: LIC SIIP, New Endowment Plus.

            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Premiums qualify for deduction under Section 80CCC (within the &#8377;1.5 lakh 80C
              combined limit). The commuted (lump sum) portion received at retirement is partially
              exempt, and the pension income received periodically is fully taxable as salary income.
              10(10D) exemption does not apply to pension plans. Examples: Jeevan Akshay, New
              Jeevan Nidhi.

        </div>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          For whole life plans like Jeevan Umang, the tax treatment follows the same rules as
          endowment plans. Survival benefits received periodically during the policy term are also
          exempt under 10(10D) if the premium conditions are satisfied.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Section 80CCC provides a specific deduction for premiums paid towards pension or annuity
          plans offered by life insurance companies, including LIC. This deduction is available only
          under the old tax regime. The maximum deduction under 80CCC is part of the overall
          &#8377;1.5 lakh limit shared with Section 80C and Section 80CCD(1).
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          If you are contributing to both a regular LIC endowment plan and an LIC pension plan,
          both premiums are competing for the same &#8377;1.5 lakh space. The endowment premium goes
          under 80C, the pension premium under 80CCC, but the combined total cannot exceed
          &#8377;1.5 lakh.

            <span className="text-warn font-semibold">Important:</span> While the premium paid
            towards a pension plan gets you a tax deduction today, the pension income received after
            retirement is fully taxable as salary/income. Additionally, if you surrender a pension
            plan, the entire surrender value is taxable in the year of receipt. The tax benefit is
            essentially a deferral, not an exemption.
          </p>

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          LIC pension plans like Jeevan Akshay, Saral Pension, and New Jeevan Nidhi are popular
          choices for retirement planning. However, from a pure tax-efficiency standpoint, NPS
          (National Pension System) offers an additional &#8377;50,000 deduction under Section
          80CCD(1B) over and above the &#8377;1.5 lakh limit, which LIC pension plans do not get.
          Consider your overall retirement and tax strategy before choosing between the two.

          the total deduction amount is entered. However, keep individual policy details handy in

          Tax rules around LIC policies have several nuances that even experienced taxpayers miss.

            </p>
            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Many policyholders assume all LIC maturity proceeds are tax-free. If your annual
              premium exceeds 10% of the sum assured (for post-2012 policies), the entire maturity
              amount becomes taxable. This is common with high-premium single-pay or limited-pay
              plans. Before buying a new policy, verify that the premium-to-SA ratio stays below 10%.

            </p>
            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              If you have opted for the new tax regime (which is now the default), you cannot claim
              80C deduction on LIC premiums. Some taxpayers continue to deduct this amount and end
              up with a mismatch during processing. Always confirm your regime choice before
              filing. If you filed under the new regime, do not include LIC premium in Chapter VIA.

            </p>
            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              If a premium is paid by a HUF and claimed in the HUF's return, the individual member
              cannot claim the same premium in their personal ITR, or vice versa. Ensure only one
              entity claims the deduction for each premium payment to avoid scrutiny.

            </p>
            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Surrendering a policy before completing 5 premium-paying years triggers Section
              80C(5), which reverses all 80C deductions claimed on that policy. This can create a
              significant tax burden in the surrender year, especially if you claimed the full
              deduction for 3-4 years. If you must exit a policy early, consider making it paid-up
              instead of surrendering.

            </p>
            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              If your maturity amount does not qualify for 10(10D) exemption, it must be reported
              as "Income from Other Sources" even if TDS has been deducted. Some taxpayers skip
              this, only to receive a notice later when the IT Department matches Form 26AS data
              with the ITR. Always cross-check your Form 26AS for any LIC-related TDS entries.

          A common and effective strategy is to buy a term insurance plan with high sum assured
          (&#8377;50 lakh to &#8377;1 crore) at a low annual premium (&#8377;8,000-15,000). This
          gives you the best life cover per rupee spent, the premium easily qualifies for 80C (well
          within 10% of SA), and the death benefit is fully tax-free. For savings, separate your
          investment into PPF, ELSS, or NPS, which offer better returns than LIC endowment plans.

        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          If you already hold multiple LIC endowment policies, review whether the total premiums
          fit within the 80C limit and whether each policy satisfies the 10% SA condition. There is
          no tax benefit to paying &#8377;2 lakh in total LIC premiums if your 80C limit is already
