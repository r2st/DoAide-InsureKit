  {
    q: "Can I get a loan on my LIC term plan?",
    a: "No. Policy loans are only available on endowment, whole life, and money-back plans that have acquired a surrender value. Term insurance plans do not build any cash value, so they are not eligible for a policy loan. ULIPs and micro insurance plans are also ineligible.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the maximum loan amount on LIC policy?",
    a: "You can borrow up to 90% of the surrender value of your policy. The exact percentage depends on the plan type and how long you have been paying premiums. LIC calculates the eligible loan amount based on the current surrender value at the time of your application.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to get a policy loan?",
    a: "If you apply online through the LIC e-Services portal (ebiz.licindia.in), the loan amount is typically credited to your bank account within 3-5 working days. For offline applications submitted at a branch, the processing takes 7-10 working days due to manual verification of the policy bond and documents.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I don't repay the loan?",
    a: "If you do not repay the policy loan, interest continues to compound on the outstanding amount. LIC charges interest half-yearly, and unpaid interest is added to the principal. If the total outstanding (principal + accumulated interest) exceeds the surrender value of the policy, LIC will automatically terminate the policy, and you will lose your life cover and all future benefits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a loan if my policy is paid-up?",
    a: "Yes, you can get a loan on a paid-up policy as long as it has an existing surrender value. Since a paid-up policy has a reduced sum assured and correspondingly lower surrender value, the eligible loan amount will be less than what you could have borrowed on a fully active policy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is LIC policy loan interest tax deductible?",
    a: "No. The interest paid on a loan taken against an individual LIC policy is not deductible under any section of the Income Tax Act. It is not eligible under Section 80C, Section 24, or any other provision. The loan interest is a personal expense and cannot be claimed as a deduction while filing your income tax return.",

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">What is a Policy Loan</h2>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          A policy loan is a facility offered by LIC that allows policyholders to borrow money
          against the surrender value of their life insurance policy. It is one of the most
          underutilised benefits of traditional LIC plans. Unlike a personal loan or credit card
          advance, a policy loan uses your own policy as collateral, which means there is no
          external credit check, no income proof required, and the interest rate is significantly
          lower than most other borrowing options.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          It is important to understand that this is not a traditional loan in the conventional
          sense. LIC essentially lends you money that your policy has already accumulated in the
          form of surrender value. Your policy continues to remain active throughout the loan
          period &mdash; your life cover stays intact, and your policy keeps earning bonuses as
          usual. You do not need to surrender or give up your policy to access these funds.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For policyholders facing a temporary financial emergency &mdash; medical expenses,
          education fees, home repairs &mdash; a policy loan is often the cheapest and fastest
          way to arrange funds without disrupting your long-term financial plan.
        </p>

            <span className="text-signal font-semibold">Key Advantage:</span>{" "}
            Unlike surrendering, a policy loan lets you access funds while keeping your life cover
            and bonus accumulation intact. It is one of the cheapest borrowing options available in
            India, with interest rates around 9% p.a.

          Not all LIC policies qualify for a loan. Your policy must meet certain conditions before
          LIC will approve a loan against it. The fundamental requirement is that the policy must
          have acquired a surrender value, which typically happens after three consecutive years
          of premium payments.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">How Much Can You Borrow</h2>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          LIC allows you to borrow up to 85-90% of the current surrender value of your policy.
          The exact percentage depends on the plan type and the policy terms. The surrender value
          itself increases with each year of premium payment, so the longer you have been paying
          premiums, the higher the loan amount you can access.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The formula is straightforward: the maximum loan amount equals the surrender value of
          your policy multiplied by the loan eligibility percentage. LIC calculates the surrender
          value based on the guaranteed surrender value plus any vested bonuses, then applies the
          eligibility percentage to arrive at the maximum loan you can take.

          LIC charges approximately 9% per annum on policy loans, calculated as simple interest

          LIC offers flexible repayment options for policy loans. There is no fixed EMI schedule
          or mandatory repayment timeline, giving you the freedom to repay at your convenience.
          However, it is important to understand how each option works to avoid the pitfall of
          compounding interest.

            <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-2">
              Pay the interest component half-yearly and repay the principal at any time of your
              choosing. This keeps the outstanding amount from growing and is the minimum you
              should aim for.

              Reduce the principal in chunks whenever you have surplus funds. There is no minimum
              repayment amount, and no penalty for partial payments. Each repayment reduces the
              interest burden going forward.

              Clear the entire outstanding loan (principal + accrued interest) at any time. There is

              If you do not repay the loan during the policy term, the outstanding amount (principal

          While a policy loan is a convenient and low-cost borrowing option, there are several
          important things you should be aware of before and after taking one. Ignoring these can
          lead to unpleasant surprises at maturity.

                <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  If you do not pay the half-yearly interest, it gets added to the principal. This
                  means you start paying interest on interest. Over several years, the outstanding
                  amount can snowball and significantly eat into your maturity value or even exceed
                  the surrender value.

                  If the total outstanding amount (principal + accumulated interest) exceeds the
                  surrender value of your policy, LIC will automatically terminate the policy. You
                  lose your life cover, all future bonuses, and the maturity benefit. This is the
                  worst-case scenario and must be avoided at all costs.

                <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  If you hold a ULIP (which is not eligible for a policy loan), you may be able to
                  make a partial withdrawal after the 5-year lock-in period. This is not a loan, so
                  there is no interest to pay. Check with your insurer for the partial withdrawal
                  rules specific to your ULIP.

                <p className="text-white/50 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Before taking a policy loan, compare the effective cost with other available
                  options like a loan against fixed deposit (7-8%) or a gold loan (8-9%). While
                  policy loans are convenient, a loan against FD may offer an even lower rate

                  The golden rule with policy loans is to repay the principal as quickly as your
                  finances allow. There is no prepayment penalty, so there is no cost to early
                  repayment. The sooner you clear the loan, the less interest you pay, and the more
                  of your maturity value you preserve.
