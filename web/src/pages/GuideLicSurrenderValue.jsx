  {
    q: "What is the surrender value of my LIC policy after 5 years?",
    a: "It depends on your plan, sum assured, and total premiums paid. The Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV) is typically around 30% of premiums paid excluding the first year. The Special Surrender Value (SSV) is usually higher, especially after 5+ years. Use our Surrender Calculator for a plan-specific estimate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I surrender my LIC policy after 3 years?",
    a: "Yes, 3 years of premium payment is the minimum requirement for a policy to acquire surrender value. However, the surrender value at year 3 will be quite low - typically around 30-35% of total premiums paid. You will lose a significant portion of your investment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is surrender value the same as paid-up value?",
    a: "No, they are different concepts. Paid-up value is the reduced sum assured your policy retains when you stop paying premiums but do not withdraw the money - the policy continues with reduced benefits until maturity. Surrender value is the actual cash you receive when you permanently exit the policy by terminating it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to get surrender value credited?",
    a: "Typically 7-15 working days after submitting all required documents at your LIC branch. Online surrender processing may be faster, with credits arriving in 7-10 working days. Delays can occur if documents are incomplete or if the policy has any pending assignments or loans.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I surrender a ULIP after 5 years?",
    a: "Yes, ULIPs have a mandatory 5-year lock-in period. After the lock-in, the fund value (NAV x units held) is the surrender value. The GSV/SSV concept does not apply to ULIPs since they are market-linked products. You simply get the current fund value at the time of surrender.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I get back all my premiums if I surrender?",
    a: "Almost never. Surrender value is always less than total premiums paid, especially in the early years. The loss is highest if you surrender in years 3-5. Even at year 10, you may only get back 55-60% of total premiums. Only policies very close to maturity (18-20 years into a 20-year term) may return close to total premiums paid.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I surrender only part of my policy?",
    a: "No, LIC does not allow partial surrender of a traditional policy. You either surrender the full policy or keep it as is. If you need partial funds, consider taking a policy loan instead - you can borrow up to 85-90% of the surrender value while keeping the policy active with full benefits.",

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">What is Surrender Value</h2>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Surrender value is the amount LIC pays you if you voluntarily terminate your policy
          before its maturity date. Think of it as the early exit value of your life insurance
          policy. When you surrender a policy, the contract between you and LIC ends permanently
          - you receive a lump sum payout, but you lose all future benefits including life cover,
          bonus accumulation, and the maturity payout.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/60 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The surrender value is always significantly less than the maturity value. This is because
          LIC incurs costs in the early years of a policy (agent commission, underwriting, policy
          administration) and these are recovered from your premiums. Surrendering early means LIC
          hasn't had enough time to generate returns on your premiums, so you get back less than
          what you paid.
        </p>

            Financial emergency where you need immediate cash, you've found significantly better
            investment options, the policy no longer fits your financial plan, or the premiums have
            become an unaffordable burden.

            you receive will almost certainly be less than the total premiums you've paid. Always
            explore alternatives like policy loans or making the policy paid-up before deciding
            to surrender.

              The minimum surrender value guaranteed by LIC from day one of the policy. It is
              calculated as a fixed percentage of total premiums paid (excluding the first year)

              SSV is usually higher than GSV for policies that have been running for 7 or more
